                  Helen Power graduated from the University of Chicago (1955) and earned a master's (1964) and doctoral degree (1966) in English from Washington University. She was a lecturer in the English department at Washington University and served as the Women and Gender Studies program's Coordinator for ten years. Helen's insight and passion for women's studies ensured that the program flourished and continues to do so. She played an important role in initiating the Stiritz Endowed Chair in Women and Gender Studies and assisted in raising funds for the matching grant to provide continued support and development of the program. As Coordinator, she negotiated with the administration for expanded resources, additional faculty, and recognition of the program's contributions to the university and to its students and faculty.  Her work as a teacher has benefited students in the United States and abroad, where she taught courses in Iran and Afghanistan and with the University of Pittsburgh's Semester-at-Sea program.  Helen Power has made critically important contributions to the Women and Gender Studies Program, to the lives of the students and faculty who have known her, and to Washington University. She has been an exemplary citizen of the University in her teaching, her collegiality, and her service.

              <p><strong>Andrea Biggs Undergraduate Research Award</strong><br><br>
                Andrea Biggs (1960-1981) was an independent spirit who advocated tirelessly for women's rights, whether creating the first anti-prom at her high school or enthusiastically fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment later in life. In that spirit, this prize is for the promotion of undergraduate research that focuses on issues relating to gender, dedicated in loving memory to Andrea's spirit, in the hopes of further nurturing that same spirit in others.<br><br>

The Andrea Biggs Undergraduate Research Award is available to all undergraduate students who are interested in conducting original research projects in the area of gender studies.<br><br>

Amount of award: $4000</p>
