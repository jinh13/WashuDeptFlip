                <h1>GRADUATE PROGRAMS</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Washington University offers a Graduate Certificate in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies for students in MA/PhD programs who wish to enhance their disciplinary studies with a concentration in gender studies.<br><br>

The Graduate Certificate in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies requires the completion of five courses, at least two of which must be drawn from 400-level or above home-based Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies courses. The additional three required courses must be drawn from a 400-level or above home-based or cross-listed Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies course or from other, Program-approved, gender-based courses (see the Director for approval). Since a certificate requires three courses beyond those required for a student's home degree, participation in the certificate may require an extra semester of graduate classes. Those not interested in a certificate, but wanting to concentrate on gender within their disciplines to enhance their credentials and enrich their training may do so by pursuing a graduate minor according to the policies of their individual departments. Other students might participate in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies courses without commitment to a concentration

<br><br><br>
<strong>How to Apply for a Graduate Certificate in Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies</strong><br>Graduate students interested in the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Graduate Certificate should first apply for admission to the Washington University department in which they wish to obtain an advanced degree. After being admitted, each student should notify his/her department advisor and the Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies Program director of plans to obtain the Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies Certificate. In addition, students should submit an "Application for Admission to Certificate Program" form to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences office, with a copy to the Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies office. The earlier we know who you are, the earlier we can include you in mailings about Program activities, lectures, conferences, and other events. Certificate application forms are available in the Graduate School office.</p>
